Contains:

- Circle map progress icon
- Artist, song name and difficulty
- Approximate star rating
- Mods used
- BPM
- Live PP value
- Potential maximum PP value
- 100/50/0 counts
- Unstable rate
- Current/maximum combo

Customizing this is really easy, just go into style.css and change the root variables to different colors if you want.

Best used for standard mode, but taiko and catch modes work fine (note that the star rating may be wildly inaccurate).

The css will fuck up if combo exceeds 99999 or if the pp exceeds 9999.

(this counter is 1150x90)
