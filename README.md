Contains:

- Beatmap background image
- Circle map progress icon
- Artist, song name and difficulty (scrolls right to left if too long)
- Approximate star rating
- Mods used
- BPM
- Live PP value
- Potential maximum PP value
- 100/50/0 counts
- Unstable rate

Customizing this is really easy, just go into style.css and change the root variables to different colors if you want.

Best used for standard mode, but taiko and catch modes work fine (note that the star rating may be wildly inaccurate).
